CollectionName=SELDI EVMS UnProcessed Data
CollectionDescription=Unprocessed SELDI bioprocessor output from EVMS (Eastern Virginia Medical School), EDRN 
		Site 92. Each spectra was calibrated and normalized to an external coefficient of 0.2 using Ciphergen's 
		"Peaks" software. Raw time of flight values were then exported as combined spread sheets 	
		representing many individual spectra produced from serum samples in each study. These files are comma 
		delimited (csv).
