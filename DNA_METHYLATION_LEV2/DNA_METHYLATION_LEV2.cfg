MethodDetails=The data was produced at the USC Epigenome Center Core. Genomic DNA samples were bisulfite converted with the Zymo EZ96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Bisulfite conversion quality was assessed using four MethyLight reactions (Campan M, Methods Mol Biol., 2009). Bisulfite-converted DNA was then whole-genome amplified, fragmented, then hybridized to the Infinium HumanMethylation27K BeadChips. Each locus has corresponding methylated and un-methylated bead types. Single-base extension using labeled nucleotides is only accomplished upon correct allele-specific primer annealing to the appropriate bead type.
