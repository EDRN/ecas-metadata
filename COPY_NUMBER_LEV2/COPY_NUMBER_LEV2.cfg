MethodDetails=41 cell lines Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment.  Analysis was performed following the "Copy Number" workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number.  A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data).  Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data).  A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number < 2 is a loss and copy number > 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping.  60 matched tumor normal pairs Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software.
