CollectionName=Lung Carcinoma - Stage I Adenomas (pool of 20 tumors)
CollectionDescription=This study produced 320 Thermo “RAW” files from a shotgun proteomics 
    profiling analysis of non-small cell lung cancer published in MCP (PMID: 22761400). 
    Pools of 19-20 specimens were created from lung squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas 
    and two sets of normal lung epithelium. Proteins were extracted, digested with trypsin and 
    the resulting peptides separated into 15 fractions by narrow-range isoelectric focusing and 
    analyzed on a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap instrument.  The manuscript describes the global proteome 
    of lung squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas and normal epithelium, and identifies 
    proteins that are significantly different between these three tissue types.
    This dataset contains the Stage I Adenomas (pool of 20 tumors).
