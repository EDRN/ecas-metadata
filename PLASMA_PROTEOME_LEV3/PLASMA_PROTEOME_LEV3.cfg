MethodDetails=Two pools of samples were used in each experiment - one consisted of a pool of plasma from controls as a reference point, the other a pool of plasma from subjects with lung cancer. Each pooled sample was immunodepleted of the top six most abundant proteins (Albumin, IgG, IgA, Transferrin, Haptoglobin, and R-1-Antitrypsin) prior to further analysis. The two pools were isotopic labeling (cysteine) and mixed before separating by anion-exchange chromatography. A total of 8 pools were collected and further separated by reverse phase chromatography. A total of 96 fractions were collected for each experiment.  Each fraction is trypsinated and analyzed by a LTQ-FT mass spectrometer coupled to a nano-flow chromatography system. Tandem MS analysis was triggered on the 5 most abundant +2 or +3 ions of each MS1 with a dynamic exclusion list.  Acquired data were processed by the Computational Proteomics Analysis System pipeline. This pipeline implements the X!Tandem search algorithm with comet score module plug-in against IPI human v3.13 sequence database. Identified peptides were further validated through PeptideProphet and inferred into proteins via ProteinProphet. A merged database search was also performed on all the spectra collected from 96 fractions of each experiment.   The relative quantification for each pair of peptides that contains cysteine residues was computed by Q3ProteinRatioParser. Only peptides with a minimum PeptideProphet score of 0.75, and mass deviation <20 ppm were considered for quantification. Ratios on a logarithmic scale of all quantified peptides were plotted on a histogram and the median of the distribution was centered at zero. All normalized peptide ratios for a specific protein were averaged to compute an overall protein ratio. Statistical significance of the protein quantitative information was obtained via two procedures: for proteins with multiple peptides quantified, a P-value for the mean log-ratio, which has mean zero under the null hypothesis, was calculated using one-sample t-test; and for proteins with a single quantitative event, the probability for the ratio was extrapolated from the distribution of ratios in a baseline-baseline experiment whereby the same sample was split in half and labeled differentially.
