CollectionDescription=Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death worldwide, with up to 25% of cases arising in never smokers.  Lung cancers in smokers and never smokers have been shown to exhibit specific genetic and clinical features which suggests they are distinct diseases.  Despite these findings, there is still much to learn about lung tumorigenesis in these two groups.  We hypothesized that if smoker and never smoker lung tumors are different diseases, they are likely driven by different molecular mechanisms and therefore likely exhibit different patterns of copy number alterations throughout the genome.  We used Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays to generate high resolution copy number profiles for lung adenocarcinomas from 30 smokers and 30 never smokers as well as cell lines derived from 20 smokers and 20 light or never smokers to elucidate global differences in genomic aberrations between these two groups.

MethodDetails=41 cell lines Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment.  Analysis was performed following the "Copy Number" workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number.  A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data).  Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data).  A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number < 2 is a loss and copy number > 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping.  60 matched tumor normal pairs Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software.
