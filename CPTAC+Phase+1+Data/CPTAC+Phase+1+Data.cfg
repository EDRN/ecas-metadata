CollectionDescription=Links to the The Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer Initiative, CPTAC Phase I 2006 - 2011, was developed to address the pre-analytical and analytical variability issues that are major barriers to the field of proteomics. These barriers were: (1) experimental design; (2) technological and technical aspects of protein identification; (3) variability related to biospecimens collection; (4) the processes of data acquisition, analysis, and reporting; (5) the lack of reproducible proteomic technologies; and (6) the lack of highly characterized and standardized reagents.The Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer Initiative, CPTAC Phase I 2006 - 2011, was developed to address the pre-analytical and analytical variability issues that are major barriers to the field of proteomics.
